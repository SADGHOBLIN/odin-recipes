    <h3>Step by Step Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
        Start with measuring out all of your ingredients and getting them ready.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>
        Combine the dry ingredients into one bowl: the flour, white sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
        Stir both mixtures together into a large bowl to create the pancake mixture. The batter will be slightly lumpy - this is normal!</li><br>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong><br>
        Next, heat a frying pan with a touch of oil on medium heat. Pour small-medium sized portions of the batter into a pan. These are your pancakes, so make them as big or as small as you wish.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong><br>
        Cook the pancakes one by one until they are golden brown on each side. It should take approximately 3-5 minutes. This is the time to show off your pancake flipping skills! </li><br>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong><br>
        Serve your pancakes hot! Top with anything that you like, but we reccomend drizzling over some maple syrup, with some chopped fruit! Yum!</li><br>
    </ol>

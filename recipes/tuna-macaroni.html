            Two tablespoons of chopped sweet onion.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Celery: </strong><br>

        <li><strong>Mayonnaise: </strong><br>
            We'll need around 200-250g depending on your preference.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Seasoning: </strong><br>

    </ul>
    <h3>Step by Step Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
        Start by preparing all the ingredients, including hard boiling the eggs, chopping up the vegetables, and draining the peas and tuna.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>
        Fill a large pot with water, and bring to boil after lightly salting it to your own preference. </li><br>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
        Add the macaroni pasta to the boiling water, allowing to cook for about 8 minutes. Keep an eye on it in order to avoid it boiling over completely. After cooking, drain the pasta before rinsing it under cold water to cool.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong><br>
        Whilst the pasta cools, get yourself a large bowl to prepare the dish in. Then stir together the macaroni pasta, tuna, peas, celery, and onion.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong><br>
        Next, mix in the mayonnaise and the seasoning. Stir quite vigorously so that all the ingredients can be distributed evenly throughout the dish. </li><br>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong><br>
        Finally, garnish with egg wedges. You can even sprinkle a bit more paprika on top! Then cover the dish with some foil, and allow it to chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour before serving.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Step 7:</strong><br>
        Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
